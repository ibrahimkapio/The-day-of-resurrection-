<strong>VERSE 3</strong><br><br>

o As the trumpet is blown for the<br> second time<br>
Every living being will be<br> resurrected to give an Account for<br> their deeds Standing under the hot<br> burning Sun for 50,000 years<br>
Side by side, where none can dare<br>
Standing naked, Stont and worried<br>
Without nothing to wear Today<br> your power, your wealth, nothing<br> will be beneficial Except those you <br> spent in fair Indeed every deed will<br> be brought into an account<br> Whether Small or huge, nothing<br> will disappear Glad tidings are the<br> believers For they shall received<br> their book with joy and laughter<br> And a severe punishment for the <br>disbelievers Since they acted blind<br> to our signs,so they will be wake<br> up blind<br>
