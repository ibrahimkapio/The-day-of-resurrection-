<strong>C) VERSE 4</strong><br><br> 
 It is an outstanding day without any doubt.<br>
the day when every soul will reflect<br> upon, what it is about. The day of<br> accountability The day when every<br> creation will give account to their<br> deeds whether good or bad<br> regardless of your identity the day<br> that is enough for us to fear the<br> almighty not in imagination but<br> rather in reality This is the day of<br> justice not inequality A day when no<br> soul will be exchange for another<br> not your friend nor your father<br> neither your mother This is the day<br> when a men will flee away from his<br> brother This is the day of regret,
<br> heart break and laughter This is the<br> day when some faces will be bright <br>laughing, rejoicing at good news in<br> sweet delight Giving their books on<br> their right
For indeed this is the<br> SOU TAL NTUS TA
KEM
The <br>Straight path And other faces<br> will be covered with dust Darkness<br> will covered them - for they have <br>everything lost Those are the
<br> disbelievers, the wicked ones.
