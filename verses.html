        <strong style="color: blueviolet;">VERSE 1</strong><br><br>
        O Wait! what makes me who i <br> am
        what was my state before <br>existence
        how do i even create <br> and sustain an alternate 
        For this <br> is the real-life question <br>you and I should be asking<br> ourselves before it is too late, even<br> see. Forty days as a drop, forty<br> days as a clinging clot of blood.<br>Here we are today—from a drop to<br> a man. to say goodbye.<br>
        Certainly, every single one of us <br> were created in the womb of our <br>mothers, so deep where none can <br> see. Forty days as a drop, forty<br> days as a clinging clot of blood.<br>Here we are today—from a drop to<br> a man.
Created in the best of form, so we<br> are made with grace and beauty<br> none can trade. Yet, here we are<br> bounded with corruptions and <br> pride
<br>
Say you are not afraid. But always<br> remember, as you work each day.<br> no matter how long it takes you in|<br> this life. One day you will be gone <br>and never come back, from<br> prominence to obscurity<br> Independent man, but today, you<br> will be dressed prepared with soft,<br> worn white clothes, being a <br>muslim you will be blessed your<br> bills and women all will be<br> addressed with four men carrying<br> you on their shoulders Today your<br> body will be laid in cold and in<br> darkness while your beds<br> remained untouched and gleaming<br> with brightness Darkness upon<br> darkness<br>
<em>KUNLU NAF SEEN ZHA EKHA TUL</em> <br> <em> MOU</em> <br>
Every life must taste the bitterness of death<br>
As your Soul departs from the body The<br> real trial begins Nothing<br>can rescue you here today. Not<br> even the whole world ransom<br> Except in clear manifestation.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>C) VERSE 2</strong><br><br>

As the last footsteps fades<br>
Then the two angles are<br> descended,
Violently coming to rade<br> MUNKAR<br> AND NAKIR,<br> the harsh and the fair<br> Who will question your soul laid<br> bare Who is you Lord? What path<br> do you take? What Seeds do you<br> sow for your soul's own sake Here <br>every single deeds are recorded<br>
Even from your minor mistakes But<br> the truthful respond will bring life<br> to light And the wrong doers will<br> tremble in fear due to that night<br> Here every Soul's destiny decided<br> right here<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>VERSE 3</strong><br><br>

o As the trumpet is blown for the<br> second time<br>
Every living being will be<br> resurrected to give an Account for<br> their deeds Standing under the hot<br> burning Sun for 50,000 years<br>
Side by side, where none can dare<br>
Standing naked, Stont and worried<br>
Without nothing to wear Today<br> your power, your wealth, nothing<br> will be beneficial Except those you <br> spent in fair Indeed every deed will<br> be brought into an account<br> Whether Small or huge, nothing<br> will disappear Glad tidings are the<br> believers For they shall received<br> their book with joy and laughter<br> And a severe punishment for the <br>disbelievers Since they acted blind<br> to our signs,so they will be wake<br> up blind.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>C) VERSE 4</strong><br><br> 
 It is an outstanding day without any doubt.<br>
the day when every soul will reflect<br> upon, what it is about. The day of<br> accountability The day when every<br> creation will give account to their<br> deeds whether good or bad<br> regardless of your identity the day<br> that is enough for us to fear the<br> almighty not in imagination but<br> rather in reality This is the day of<br> justice not inequality A day when no<br> soul will be exchange for another<br> not your friend nor your father<br> neither your mother This is the day<br> when a men will flee away from his<br> brother This is the day of regret,
<br> heart break and laughter This is the<br> day when some faces will be bright <br>laughing, rejoicing at good news in<br> sweet delight Giving their books on<br> their right
For indeed this is the<br> SOU TAL NTUS TA
KEM
The <br>Straight path And other faces<br> will be covered with dust Darkness<br> will covered them - for they have <br>everything lost Those are the
<br> disbelievers, the wicked ones.
